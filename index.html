	  <h2>Why Your Dog Needs a Daily Multivitamin</h2>
 	  <p>Just like humans, dogs can benefit from taking a daily multivitamin. Although high-quality dog food contains many essential nutrients, it may not always provide everything your dog needs. Factors like age, size, breed, and even environmental stress can impact a dog’s nutritional requirements.

Additionally, some dogs are picky eaters or may not get the balanced diet they need every day, even when given premium food.

It is formulated with a broad spectrum of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, all tailored to support your dog’s overall health.
